   <p class="words">My only previous experiences with coding are the two classes that I took last semester. 
    I took Core 1: Interaction, where we used Visual Studio code to learn HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. 
    I also took an elective at Lang called Code Toolkit: Javascript where we used p5.js. 
    I feel as though I have a very baseline understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as using p5 to create sketches. 
    <br><br>
    I resonated with CSS and HTML the most, but CSS animations and using javascript are still confusing to me. 
    More specifically, using functions in javascript to reference other parts of the code confuses me. 
    <br><br>
    I am both excited and apprehensive about learning code. Sometimes it is daunting because it seems like such a 
    difficult thing to understand, and can occasionally seem like dull work. But, being shown examples of what 
    code can help graphic designers accomplish will help me stay inspired to learn. 
    <br><br>
    I think that understanding code to a certain extent opens up a multitude of opportunities for graphic designers. 
    Knowing code allows graphic designers to be able to follow almost any design path they want. So, coding will 
    fit in with my career after college by allowing me to go in many directions, and qualifying me for many more 
    potential jobs. It will be a toolbox that helps me to be even more creative.
    <br><br>
    I have only ever used Visual Studio Code, but I am open to learning and using new text editors.
    <br><br>
    I have used GitHub before in both of the coding classes I took last semester.
    <br><br>
    A creative analogy to describe the relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript might be that if the HTML 
    is a puppet, the CSS is the puppet's costume or clothing, and the Javascript is the puppeteer, allowing the 
    puppet to move and interact with other things. HTML is the basic framework for your content, CSS allows you 
    to style the content, and Javascript is what can make the content more interactive and motion-oriented.

        <a href="https://www.fairetype.com/">Faire Type Foundry</a> <br>
    This type foundry is important to me because Sabrina Nacmias came to give a lecture at Parsons last semester.
    I was very inspired by her career story and I enjoyed hearing from a successful young woman doing something 
    that I myself would love to do. </li>

        <a href="https://www.kielm.com/">Kiel Mutschelknaus</a> <br>
    This is another person who came to lecture at Parsons for the CD lecture series. I appreciate how he 
    incorporates code into his graphic design to create mesmerizing motion graphics. I specifically like 
    his work with typography and text effects. </li> </ul>
